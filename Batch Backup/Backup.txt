 Version History
=================

Version 1.1
+ Changed the destination path not to use mapped network drives (drives
  disconnect on logoff - shares reccomended in place of mapped network drives
  (ie. \\client000\share)
+ Fixed a potential problem where if the remote share was unavailable, the
  program would set itself as having backed up the files, when it had actually
  just ran the script and failed all of the copies, so it would simply skip
  to the end and update the file
+ Added a log file to keep track of when the program executes and whether it
  completed successfully or failed

Version 1.0
+ Added incremental backup feature based on the date the program was last
  executed (uses file i/o in a file of the same name with the extension ".ini"
+ Automatically runs a full backup if the program has not been executed before
+ Changed copy command to use xcopy to take into account subdirectories,
  incremental backups, etc.
+ Fixed path on xcopy to NOT have a "\" at the end - this causes the copy to
  fail due to an invalid path
+ Fixed a fault that would allow for the script to set it's status as having
  completed the backup if it was prematurely terminated (added ini file update
  code to the end of the file after the copy is completed)
